## Real Time Angular and Firebase Chatting Application

## Summary
This project uses AngularJS for front end and Googles Firebase for the backend code. Using firebase allows the user to see text updates in real time without refreshing the page. 

## Installation 

Start by cloning the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dvcv/chat.git <your-frontend-project-name>
```

## Configuration

The project uses Node to run a JS server in development. 
Install the project dependencies by running:

```
$ npm install
```

## Run the Application

Run the application server:

```
$ npm start
```

The server will start up. To stop the server, press `cntrl + c`.

### Difference between Pages and Templates

The `templates` directory should hold any HTML files used as templates in Angular states configured by UI Router. All other HTML files belong in the `pages` directory.
